I am currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Mathematics Sciences at Beijing Normal University, under the supervision of [Huajie Chen](http://math0.bnu.edu.cn/~chenhuajie/). I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Beijing Normal University in 2020. Much of my research work is interdisciplinary, combining rigorous mathematics with modelling and applications in chemistry and materials science.

Research interests
======
 * Modeling and analysis for low dimensional incommensurate materials; 
 * Numerical methods for electronic structure calculations; 
 * Software development for quantum chemistry and materials science.
