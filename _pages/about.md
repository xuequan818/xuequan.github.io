I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Mathematics Sciences at Beijing Normal University, under the supervision of [Prof. Huajie Chen](http://math0.bnu.edu.cn/~chenhuajie/).

 My research interests are: 
 * Modeling and analysis for low dimensional incommensurate materials; 
 * Numerical methods for electronic structure calculations; 
 * Software development for quantum chemistry and materials science.
