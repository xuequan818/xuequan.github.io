I am currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Mathematics Sciences at Beijing Normal University, under the supervision of [Huajie Chen](http://math0.bnu.edu.cn/~chenhuajie/). I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Beijing Normal University in 2020. 

Additionally, I visited [Antoine Levitt](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~antoine.levitt/) in the Laboratoire de mathématiques d’Orsay at Université Paris-Saclay from December 2023 to November 2024, and [Daniel Massatt](https://sites.google.com/view/danielmassatt) in the Mathematics Department at Louisiana State University from June 2023 to September 2023. 

My research interests are: modeling and analysis for low dimensional incommensurate materials; numerical methods for electronic structure calculations; software development for quantum chemistry and materials science.
